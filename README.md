###### The "Kiss" MVC Flutter Framework

In keeping with the ["KISS Principle"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle), this was an attempt
to offer the MVC design pattern to Flutter in a simple 
and intrinsic fashion.

**MVC** aims to decouple its three major components allowing
for efficient code reuse and parallel development. Each responsible
for they're separate tasks:

* Model - the Controllerâ€™s source for data
* View - concerned with how the data is displayed.
* Controller - the brains of the operation.

Only four simple Classes involved, the intent here is 
to make the implementation of **MVC** as intuitive as possible.

Simply inherit from the appropriate MVC componment Classes: 
AppModel, AppView and AppConntroller

Dependency Injection is introduced in its purest form:
Each **MVC** component is passed to each other as parameters.

In Flutter, its possible to 'try before you fork' by inserting
into your metadata file, **pubspec.yaml**, the git url to this repo.:
